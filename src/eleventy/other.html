<p>Here are some other personal projects that I've worked on.

<ul>
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://hitchhikers.ticklethepanda.co.uk">The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</a></h3>
    <p>A little app that I made as part of an Arthur Dent fancy dress costume.
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://tartan-ify.ticklethepanda.co.uk">Tartan-ify</a></h3>
    <p>A tool to analyse patterns within a single piece of music. Most of the
      patterns end up looking like tartan, hence the name.
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://dm.dnd.ticklethepanda.co.uk">When I'm a Dungeon Master</a></h3>
    <p>My Dungeons and Dragons adventures that I run as a dungeon master.
  <li>
    <h3><a href="https://dnd.ticklethepanda.co.uk">When I'm a Player</a></h3>
    <p>My Dungeons and Dragons characters that I've played.
</ul>
