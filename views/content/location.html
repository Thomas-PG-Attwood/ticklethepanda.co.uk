<p class="first-paragraph">Since around 2012, I've had a phone that keeps track of my location whenever it's on, using Google's Location History. When I first started writing this software, I wanted to see where I had visited in the UK and where I most frequently was. I decided that the best way to represent this was to use a heat-map.</p>
