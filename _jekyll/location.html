description: An analysis of my location history from Google Location History.

<p>Since around 2012, I've had a phone that keeps track of my location whenever it's on, using Google's Location History. When I first started writing this software, I wanted to see where I had visited in the UK and where I most frequently was. I decided that the best way to represent this was to use a heat-map. I then turned this into a web service so that I can more easily update the images.</p>
<h2>My location history</h2>
<div id="location-slideshow" class="location-slideshow form inline">
  <ul class="types">
    <li>
      <input type="radio" id="location-facet-all" name="location-facet" value="all">
      <label for="location-facet-all">All</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <input type="radio" id="location-facet-year-month" name="location-facet" value="year-month">
      <label for="location-facet-year-month">Year month</label>
    </li>
    <li>
      <input type="radio" id="location-facet-month" name="location-facet" value="month">
      <label for="location-facet-month">Month</label>
    </li>

      <input type="radio" id="location-facet-weekday" name="location-facet" value="weekday">
      <label for="location-facet-weekday">Weekday</label>
    </li>
  </ul>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/TickleThePanda/location-history">The code</a></h2>
A quick (relatively high level) how-to on turning your data into a heatmap:
<ol>
  <li>Retrieve your data from Google</li>
  <li>Load the data from the file</li>
  <li>Strip out the most inaccurate points</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a more useable coordinate system</li>
  <li>Convert the data to a more efficient data structure, like a Quadtree - <em>perhaps the most fun part of the process</em></li>
  <li>Create a heatmap array (number of points within each (x,y) of the viewport) from a viewport (scale, center point, and dimensions of the projection) - <em>another fun part</em></li>
  <li>Create a painter for the heatmap (defines color, pixel size and writes the data to some sort of canvas)</li>
  <li>Save the image to file</li>
</ol>
