  description: I visited Kew Gardens with my girlfriend in June, 2013. For most of
    it we did lounge around; however, when we did move about, it was a perfect day
    for taking photographs. These are my favourite photographs from that day.

  description: During the summer of 2014, I visited Ireland with my family. These
    photos were taken while I was there with a Pentax K1000 using the standard 50mm
    f/2 Pentax-M lens and 200 or 400 ISO film and was my first time using film.
